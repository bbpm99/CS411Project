New user wants to create an account and use the product. They see the main page with areas to sign in and create an account. They click the create an account button and the program prompts them to input an email and password. After typing in the information, they are notified if that email is already in use. The user will be sent an email asking them to confirm their account creation through a confirmation link. Once their account has been created and confirmed, they can choose the sign in option where they will enter their account’s email and password. After signing in, they will be able to access and use the rest of the application.
