User wants to access and edit an itinerary that they saved and want to make changes. After logging in, the user will be able to click on a button that says “My Account” that will allow them to see their profile. In this profile there will be a list of saved trips. When they click on one of these saved trips they will be brought to a new screen that displays the saved itinerary. They are able to click on the events of the itinerary and will be shown a brief description of the place/event and a link to its website. There will also be options to edit or remove the event. If they click remove, the event will simply be erased from the itinerary, leaving the space on the calendar open. If they select edit, they will be able to link to another event so that they can replace the current one, and they will be able to edit the length of the event through a text input for starting and ending times.
